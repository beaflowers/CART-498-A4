# Project Report

It was trickier to implement Jungian ideas than I thought it would be - image generation is fairly different from text generation in that you can't just give it a generalized prompt and expect it to do what you want (since it's not following token likelihood in the same way). I researched some Jungian dream analysis, though a lot of it online felt like vague slop?, and tried to incorporate specific archtypes into the image generation prompt. These additional descriptors are added to the user's dream submission in order to give it a more reflective sense. The additional Jungian elements added to the prompt are likely much longer than the initial dream itself, but are all for setting style and mood, though they also add certain elements and objects (like shadows and clocks). 

### How To Use the Dream Machine

Simply type in your dream, then press "generate image". Describe yourself, if you are a figure in the dream, otherwise you will appear as a man. It tends to take a while to load, so sit back and reflect for a moment. 

### Reflections

I actually had the time to do more than just the bare minimum for this assignment and I'm grateful for that - I could tweak repeatedly to actually get Jungian elements to show up. I've struggled with image generation prompting before (and frankly still do, but honestly I believe that to be for the best, for the most part) and it takess quite a lot of description to get anything close to what I'm aiming for. Possible improvements would be a better look to the website, and a textural analysis as well, rather than just an image prompt... Maybe trying out a different image model?
